# 🚀 AI-Based Human Recognition & Activity Detection for Microgravity

## 📌 Overview

An **edge-deployed AI-powered monitoring system** designed to recognize humans and detect their activities in microgravity environments such as spacecraft and space stations.

The system combines **Human Recognition** and **Human Activity Detection (HAD)** using lightweight computer vision models that can operate locally on **space-hardened edge hardware**, enabling real-time monitoring without depending on continuous cloud connectivity.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In microgravity environments, continuously monitoring astronauts and their interactions with equipment is challenging due to:

* Unpredictable body movements caused by microgravity.
* Difficulty in identifying and tracking human activities.
* Limited computational resources and communication bandwidth.
* Need for real-time monitoring with minimal latency.
* Safety risks associated with incorrect instrument handling or abnormal activities..

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Our solution provides an intelligent edge-based monitoring system that:

* 👤 **Recognizes humans** and tracks their presence within the monitored environment.
* 🧍 **Detects human activities** such as gestures, posture, movement, and instrument handling.
* ⚡ Performs **real-time inference locally** on edge hardware.
* 📡 Reduces dependency on cloud connectivity and minimizes communication latency.
* 🚨 Generates alerts for predefined abnormal or potentially unsafe activities.
